This is no ordinary fest. This is a fest curated by a team that hasn't slept for days, a team that's surviving on coffee just to make sure that the Bangalore's Tech Circuit gets the finest of the events possible. 
Tech Solstice brings to you a platform to compete with the lot that follows Linus as enthusiastically as you do. Both Sebastian and Torvalds.
From E-sports to Hackathons, everyone can find an event right for their interests.<br><br>
