Understood the booking flow (get access to database)

Idea 1 ->
    give two options to users -> Register as team leader or Register as a team member
    If registered as a team leader ->
        follow the normal payment flow and generate a qr and add to db
        add two new tables ->
            team name with their ids, the event they are partaking in, invite link, isPaymentVerified, openForMembers, memberLimit, currentMemberCount
            another would be a table that will contain the team members ->
                it will contain the user_id, isTeamLeader, team_id.
    If registered as a team member ->
        will open a dialog box where the user will enter the invite Code
        will check if the memberLimit <= currentMemberCount, isPaymentVerified == True, openForMembers == True
